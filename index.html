        <h2>A Tribute to Nigerian youths</h2>
        <p>I wanted to write an eulogy about person i respect,but i have so many and most of them fall under the category of the Nigerian youths</p>

        </br>To our fallen heroes, to all the youths that are tired, to all who have suffered. To all who have given up! but we rise from the ashes. I acknowledge every single Nigerian youth who stands up against injustice. To thsoe who want no more <strong>police brutality, injustice, irrelevant polices</strong> 
        </br> I admire your courage.To all who came out to make out voices heard. We have been <em> in suffering for long</em>
          </p>
          <p>
              I applaud those who have lost a loved one due to the following:
              <ol>

                  <li>Injustice in the court system</li>

                  <li>Corrupt Policies</li>
